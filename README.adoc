= Atari 8bit WNF Compiler

Yes! The first ideas for such compiler are over 30 years old!

de_DE:: WNF f√ºr "WiNiFe"-Projekt oder "Wird nie fertig" (ak. Baumann und Clausen Comedy)

en_EN:: WNF stays for "WiNeFi" project or "Will never finished" (german gov. comedy)

This small Java application has been rewritten in Java language
since october 2020.

It reads Atari 8bit wnf-files and compile these files to 6502-assembler.
The assembler files are full compatible to
https://atari.miribilist.com/atasm/[atasm-Assembler],
and mostly compatible to mac/65 from OSS.

* [x] read full wnf file
* [x] get_symbol
* [x] expressions
* [x] generate assembler of expressions
* [x] peephole optimizer


== TODOs
* [ ] lot of german comments, sorry

== Build
This is a Apache Maven based Java program. You need at least OpenJDK 8.
To build it, just call `mvn verify` or use the
bash-script `./build.sh`, which also simply call Apache-Maven.

There exist a lot JUnit tests, therefore you see lot of output.
The source-code-coverage of tests is more then 95%.


== Installation
After successful build, copy the `compiler/target/wnf-compiler.jar` file
to a directory, where a path in your $PATH variable shows to.
Then create the following simple script like
[source]
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT=$(dirname $0)
java -jar ${SCRIPT}/wnf-compiler.jar $@

Rename this script to `wnfc` and give it execute flags like `chmod +x wnfc`.
Now on console, call `wnfc` and you will get the usage information of the compiler.

Here also a script exists.
`./deploy.sh` but due to the fact that every user has a different environment, you should not use it.
It is just for me to install this compiler on my Windows (mingw) PC
and on my Linux PC. Maybe you find it useful.


== Parameter
Usage::
wnfc [OPTIONS] [FILE]

OPTIONS::

-O level:: give the wished optimization level,
0 for no optimization,
1 for normal optimization,
2 for also branch optimizations.
The wnfc compiler contains a very rudimentare peephole optimizer.
Which takes a look into the generated assembler source and replace some constructs by faster one.

-v level:: give the verbose level

-I path:: path where to search for include files.
The current path is default.
The -I parameter can give more than once

-o path:: the output path, where to copy the generated ASM/INC files.

-noscm:: Deactivate the shift/(add|sub) and use @IMULT function all the time.

FILE:: give one source file. Currently it is not possible to
give more than one file.


== PLAIN

This is only the plain compiler to compile wnf-files to 6502-assembler.
Currently you can only compile the Oxygene Be sources.

More include files to build other things will follow soon.

== Sorry
This Java Application has been created very fast out of my original
compiler written in Turbo-Basic-XL.
See link:[turbobasic/README.adoc].
Due to the fact it is a very old german project (over 30 years old), lot of comments
also in the Java source are in german.

You need to name this compiler `wnfc` to build Oxygene Be from source, because there exists a Makefile in the sources which use wnfc as compiler.
